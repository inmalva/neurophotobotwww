            <h2>1. General Provisions</h2>
            <p>This policy governs the terms of refunds and cancellations for digital services provided through NeuroPhoto Bot.</p>
            <p>All offered services are digital, and refunds are issued partially depending on which stages of service delivery have been completed.</p>
            <p>By making a payment, the user confirms acceptance of this policy.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Refund Policy</h2>
            
            <h3>2.1. Refund after Model Training</h3>
            <p>If the process of training a personal AI model has not yet started, the user may request a full refund.</p>
            <p>If the training process has already been launched and successfully completed, €3 will be deducted from the total payment — this amount covers the computational resources used to train the model.</p>

            <h3>2.2. Refund after Image Generations</h3>
            <p>A fee of €0.10 (ten cents) is deducted for each generated image.</p>
            <p>Example: if the user trained a model (€3) and created 50 images, the total deduction will be: €3 (training) + €5 (50 × €0.10) = €8.</p>

            <h3>2.3. Refund for Subscription</h3>
            <p>If the user purchased an annual subscription, a refund is available proportionally to the number of unused full months.</p>
            <p>If the subscription was used for more than one month, the refund amount is calculated as follows:</p>
            <p>The total cost of the subscription minus the payment for the used full months.</p>
            <p>Example: annual subscription €200, used for 2.5 months → deduction: 3 × €20 = €60, refund amount €140.</p>

            <h3>2.4. Exceptions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Refunds are not available if all generation credits have been used.</li>
                <li>Refunds are not issued if the user has violated the Terms of Service.</li>
                <li>Refunds are not possible once the digital service has been fully delivered.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.5. How to Request a Refund</h3>
            <p>To request a refund, please contact our support team via Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/ruslan_comuna_support" target="_blank">https://t.me/ruslan_comuna_support</a></p>

                <li>reason for the refund request.</li>

            <h2>3. Cancellation Policy</h2>
            
            <h3>3.1. Cancellation of Model Training</h3>
            <p>If the training process has not yet started, the user may cancel the order and receive a full refund.</p>
            <p>If the training process has already started or been completed, cancellation is not possible since the service has already been delivered.</p>

            <h3>3.2. Cancellation of Image Generations</h3>
            <p>Generation can be canceled only before it starts.</p>
            <p>Once the generation is completed, no refund will be issued since the result has already been delivered to the user.</p>

            <h3>3.3. Cancellation of Subscription</h3>
            <p>Users may cancel their subscription at any time through their account or by contacting the support team.</p>
            <p>After cancellation, the subscription remains active until the end of the paid period, and no further payments are charged.</p>
            <p>For early cancellation of an annual subscription, the refund is calculated proportionally to the remaining full months (see Section 2.3).</p>

            <h3>3.4. Additional Provisions</h3>
            <p>Cancellation requested after a digital service has started is considered a completed transaction and is not refundable.</p>
            <p>The service reserves the right to deny cancellation requests in cases of Terms of Service violations or abuse of the system.</p>
